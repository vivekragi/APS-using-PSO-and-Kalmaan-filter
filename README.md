# APS-using-PSO-and-Kalmaan-filter

prj: [RV] - stands for the project, and name of the developer is the template to follow.

An autopilot is a system used to control the trajectory of any vehicle without constand hands on control by human operator being required. We believe that exploiting the prowess of Artificial/Swarm Intelligence can enhance the performance of an autopilot and to achieve this we used a genetic algorithm namely Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) which provides optimised values of measurements by searching the state space using many entities a.k.a swarm of particles and this has been of keen interest in the recent times. Our quest in this project is all about fusing the above optimisation with the ever green Kalman filter in an effective manner to get an optimised estimate of the measured state
